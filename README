You must break the RESET EN jumper on the board to disable automatic reset
when you start a serial connection.

Windows 7 64-bit using MATLAB R2013a and Arduino 1.0.5

## Known issues
For an unknown reason it is incompatible with HP Compaq dc7800p PCs.
Arduino responds to commands but the buffer can't be read. I posted about
this on the Arduino forum. For more info see:
